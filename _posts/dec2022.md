## Team Updates

Team 246, the Lobstah Bots, has been continuing our offseason work this fall. As we eagerly approach build season, we need your help!

On January 7, the team will learn this year’s FIRST® Robotics Challenge and begin the process of prototyping and constructing our robot. Although we currently have some tools and parts in our lab from previous seasons, each year’s game calls for new purchases and specialized parts. Your contributions are extremely valuable to our team! We have very ambitious goals for this season and any help you can provide will be greatly appreciated.

Brandon finished leading mechanical trainings, and Sonya recently began electrical trainings this month. Our CAD and programming trainings are still ongoing outside of the lab, and some members of the team have also spent time designing a new cart to hold batteries.

George and the outreach subteam have been very busy developing our new lobster-themed brand and managing sponsorships. We are pleased to announce that the Bayer Fund and the Gene Haas Foundation have provided the team with grants this year. The subteam and other members also recently volunteered at the BUA "Girl Power" STEM admission event last week; we showed our robot to prospective 8th graders and had fun helping them drive it around the BUA gym.

We can’t wait for the build season kickoff as it quickly approaches! This year’s kickoff will be on **January 7th** and will reveal to all teams the game for this season. Stay tuned, as the team plans to send more detailed newsletters before and during the build season to keep parents and alumni up to date with the team. 

Thank you for all your contributions! If you want to be more involved or have any questions, you can email us at [lobstahbots@gmail.com](lobstahbots@gmail.com) and we would be happy to respond!

Sincerely,

The BUA Robotics Team (The Lobstah Bots)
