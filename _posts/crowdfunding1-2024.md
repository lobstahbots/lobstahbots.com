Hello!

We are halfway into our crowdfunding campaign and halfway to our goal of $5000! Thank you to all who have donated—and to all who will!

If you’re thinking about making a donation but haven’t yet, now is a great time to act! If you donate more than $100, we will even name a lobster after you! Every dollar makes a huge difference. Funds raised will go towards the costs of registration, parts, and transportation, which are crucial for our team to compete this season. Check out the page [here](https://lobstahbots.com/donate)!

Here’s the impact you can make by donating:

- **$10** buys us 1 bag of bolts
- **$100** buys us 1 electronic motor controller
- **$500** buys us 1 robot information processing unit
- **$1000** supplies us with all electrical components for one season
- **$4000** covers registration costs for District Championships
- **$8000** covers registration costs for World Championships!
