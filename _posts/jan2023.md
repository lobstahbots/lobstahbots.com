#### The team watching the 2023 _FIRST®_ Charged Up kickoff video.

Last Saturday, _FIRST®_ revealed the Charged Up robotics game for 2023 in this year’s kickoff (See the reveal video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zpflsYc4PA&ab_channel=FIRSTRoboticsCompetition))! The whole team spent the day at BUA thoroughly reading the rules of this year’s game and analyzing different game pieces and actions. Before we start making our robot, we think it is valuable to spend time in smaller groups going over all the possibilities and different types of robots we may see in the spring.

#### The team discussing priorities for the robot this season and analyzing different possible builds.

On Sunday, the team continued thinking about the game and made important decisions on the robot we want to make. We created a list of actions we need, want, and wish our robot will be able to complete this season. Afterwards, the team split into groups and brainstormed ideas for main mechanisms we will have on the robot. This year, the most important mechanisms will be an actuator to grab game elements and a contraption that can easily move that actuator around. In the coming days and weeks, the team plans to prototype ideas and begin the process of building our robot!

Last weekend was super exciting for the team, and parent involvement was vital to that! We are really grateful for the time and food parents provided for us. On Saturday evening, the team also gave parents a tour of the lab and showed them some of our older robots' mechanisms and our electrical test bench!
