Last weekend, the Lobstah Bots traveled to Merrimack, NH for our first off-season competition this year. This was the first off-season event the team has attended in many years, and we were really excited for the opportunity to compete during the fall and introduce new members to the thrills of competition! Offseason competitions use the past year’s official rules, and teams bring the same robots. These events offer a fun and low-stakes opportunity to have some fun before the next season starts!

We used this offseason competition as an opportunity for all returning team members to try their hand at driving the robot, and it was exciting to see so many new faces cycling through the drive team. After six qualification matches, our team managed to place 5th out of 24 teams! Thanks to some great scouting by many of the freshmen who attended (Jacob, Audrey, Teddy, Coco, Eddie, Dora, Nate, and Ziyan '27, led by Kendree and Ella '25), we were able to make a strong pick list and form a killer four robot playoff alliance. In our playoff matches, we _clawed_ out two wins, including one nail-biting win by a single point! We’re planning to attend another offseason competition, N.E.R.D., on October 14, so keep your eyes peeled for updates on that event!

In the meantime, the Outreach and Business subteam has been busy applying for robotics grants for the coming season. We’re happy to announce that we have already received three major grants, including contributions from the Bayer Fund, Boeing, and Boston Scientific.

On Tuesday, we demonstrated at BUA’s annual activity fair. In the coming weeks, we plan to finish onboarding new members onto the team, and in mid-October we expect to officially start our fall training. Trainings are split into focused groups by subteam (Mechanical, Electrical, Programming, etc.), and this year we are also planning to work on some major team-wide projects in the offseason.
