Two weeks ago the Lobstah Bots traveled to Springfield to compete in the FIRSTÂ® New England District Championships. Though we were placed in the hardest division and given a tough set of matches, we were able to finish 24th out of the 45 teams. While we did not get selected for the playoffs, the team still enjoyed an amazing time during qualifications and watching the intense elimination and finals matches.

This was our first appearance at District Championships since 2016, and it was truly a full team effort that got us there. As our season comes to a close, we could not be more proud of every studentâ€™s hard work and dedication to the team this year. Not to mention the immeasurable contributions from all of our mentors who have given the team so much time and help this season.

Looking forward, the team plans to continue competing at offseason events this summer and fall, so stay tuned for more updates! We are looking forward to displaying our robot and sharing our experience with many students at Fenway Parkâ€™s STEM event today (April 20).

This season would not have been possible without all of the generous support from our sponsors, parents, and alumni. Your continued contributions have helped the team in so many ways this season. From donations, Saturday dinners, endless carpooling help, our recent tool fundraising drive, and more, we are so grateful.
